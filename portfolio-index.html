  <h1>graphic design</h1>
    <p>This is where I'll describe my graphic design pieces, which I haven't decided what they will be yet. Definitely logos.

  <h1>just for fun</h1>
    <p>I'm excited about this seciton. It will include illustrations, crochet pieces, a few examples of handlettering, and maybe some embroidery projects. The purpose of this section is to show that I have a wide range of hobbies and skills and that being creative is a lifestyle and not just a job.</p>
